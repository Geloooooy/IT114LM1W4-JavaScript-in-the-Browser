            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            // Answer: Callbacks and then-catch: These are common patterns used with promises. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to another function and executed later. then and catch are methods used on promises to handle success and error conditions, respectively.
            //Await-try-catch: This is a more modern approach using the async/await syntax. It provides a more readable and synchronous-like code structure, making error handling with try-catch straightforward.
            //When to use:
           // Use callbacks and then-catch in older codebases or scenarios where async/await is not supported.
            //Use async/await for modern code for its simplicity and improved readability. async/await is especially useful when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations in sequence.
